# ✅ FIXED! Your Dev Server is Running on Port 8081

## 🎯 THE CORRECT URL TO USE:

Your dev server is running on **port 8081**, not 5173!

### **Open this URL instead:**

```
http://localhost:8081/login
```

---

## 🚀 QUICK TEST NOW:

1. **Open your browser**

2. **Copy and paste this URL:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8081/login
   ```

3. **You should see the login form!**

4. **Enter credentials:**
   - Email: `aplegolegaon@gmail.com`
   - Password: `Aplegolegaon@1972`

5. **Click Login**

6. **Expected:** Redirects to `http://localhost:8081/admin`

## 📌 Why Port 8081?

Your terminal shows:
```
Port 8080 is in use, trying another
VITE v5.4.19  ready in 396 ms on port 8081
```

This means:
- Port 5173 was already in use
- Port 8080 was also in use
- Vite automatically chose port 8081
- **This is normal and OK!**

---

## ✅ ALL YOUR LOCAL URLS:

Since your dev server is on port **8081**, use these URLs:

| Page | URL |
|------|-----|
| Homepage | `http://localhost:8081/` |
| Login | `http://localhost:8081/login` |
| Admin Panel | `http://localhost:8081/admin` |

---

## 🌐 For Production/Deployed Site:

Your deployed site still uses the normal URLs (no port number):

```
https://aplegolegaon.com/login
```

This will work on all devices!

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS:

1. ✅ Open: `http://localhost:8081/login`
2. ✅ Test login with your credentials
3. ✅ If login works locally → Test on deployed site
4. ✅ Test on mobile with deployed URL

---

**GO NOW: http://localhost:8081/login** 🚀
